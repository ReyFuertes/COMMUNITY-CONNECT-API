## FinanceService Specifics

The FinanceService handles all financial transactions, including online payments and expense tracking.

### Payment Gateway Configuration

For online payments to function, you must configure the API keys for Stripe and Xendit (for local e-wallets like GCash, PayMaya, GrabPay, GoTyme). These settings are found in `FinanceService/FinanceService.Api/appsettings.Development.json` and should be managed securely in production environments (e.g., Kubernetes secrets, Azure Key Vault).

Example `appsettings.json` (replace placeholders with actual keys):

```json
{
  "Stripe": {
    "SecretKey": "sk_live_YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY",
    "SuccessUrl": "http://yourfrontend.com/payment/success",
    "CancelUrl": "http://yourfrontend.com/payment/cancel"
  },
  "Xendit": {
    "SecretKey": "xnd_live_YOUR_XENDIT_SECRET_KEY",
    "SuccessUrl": "http://yourfrontend.com/payment/success",
    "FailureUrl": "http://yourfrontend.com/payment/failure"
  }
}
```

### Azure Blob Storage for Proofs of Payment

The FinanceService uses Azure Blob Storage for storing uploaded proofs of payment (e.g., bank transfer receipts).

Configure your Azure Storage connection string and container name in `FinanceService/FinanceService.Api/appsettings.Development.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "AzureStorage": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME>;AccountKey=<YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
  },
  "AzureStorage": {
    "ContainerName": "payment-proofs"
  }
}
```

*   **`ConnectionStrings:AzureStorage`**: Your Azure Storage account connection string. For local development, `UseDevelopmentStorage=true` can be used with Azurite.
*   **`AzureStorage:ContainerName`**: The name of the blob container where receipts will be stored (defaults to `payment-proofs`).

### Webhook Endpoints

To receive real-time payment status updates, you must configure webhooks with your payment providers:

*   **Stripe**: Configure a webhook endpoint pointing to `http://localhost:8080/api/finance/webhooks/stripe` (adjust for production URL) for `checkout.session.completed` events.
*   **Xendit**: Configure a webhook endpoint pointing to `http://localhost:8080/api/finance/webhooks/xendit` (adjust for production URL) for `invoice paid` and `invoice expired` events.

## SecurityService Specifics

The SecurityService handles visitor management, check-ins, and parcel tracking.

### Azure Blob Storage for Parcel Photos

The SecurityService uses Azure Blob Storage to store photos of received parcels.

Configure your Azure Storage connection string and container name in `SecurityService/SecurityService.Api/appsettings.Development.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "AzureStorage": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME>;AccountKey=<YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
  },
  "AzureStorage": {
    "ContainerName": "security-files"
  }
}
```

*   **`ConnectionStrings:AzureStorage`**: Your Azure Storage account connection string. For local development, `UseDevelopmentStorage=true` can be used with Azurite.
*   **`AzureStorage:ContainerName`**: The name of the blob container where parcel photos will be stored (defaults to `security-files`).

### Visitor Access Code / QR Code Generation

The API generates a unique access code (string) for visitor passes. Frontend applications can then use this string to generate a scannable QR code image.

### Guard Application

Security personnel can use a dedicated application (mobile/tablet) to:
*   Scan visitor QR codes to check guests in/out.
*   Log new parcels and upload photos.

## BookingService Specifics

The BookingService manages the booking of shared community facilities and amenities.

### Integrations

*   **FinanceService**: Used for handling booking fees and security deposits. When a booking with a fee is created, the BookingService initiates a payment request to the FinanceService.
*   **CommunicationHub**: Used for sending notifications to residents regarding booking confirmations, approvals, rejections, and other status updates.
*   **UserAndUnitManagement**: Integrates with this service to validate Resident and Unit IDs when creating bookings.

### Configuration

The BookingService needs to know the base URLs of the services it integrates with. Configure these in `BookingService/BookingService.Api/appsettings.Development.json` (or environment variables for production):

```json
{
  "FinanceService": {
    "BaseUrl": "http://communityconnect-financeservice-api-dev:8084"
  },
  "CommunicationHub": {
    "BaseUrl": "http://communityconnect-communicationhub-api-dev:8082"
  },
  "UserAndUnitManagement": {
    "BaseUrl": "http://communityconnect-userandunitmgmtapi-dev:8081"
  }
}
```

*   **`FinanceService:BaseUrl`**: The base URL of the FinanceService API.
*   **`CommunicationHub:BaseUrl`**: The base URL of the CommunicationHub API.
*   **`UserAndUnitManagement:BaseUrl`**: The base URL of the UserAndUnitManagement API.

### Booking Rules Engine

Administrators can set various rules for each amenity, such as:
*   Maximum booking duration (e.g., "2 hours").
*   Capacity limits (e.g., "10 people").
*   Blackout dates (e.g., no bookings on holidays).

These rules are checked automatically when a resident attempts to create a booking.

### Approval Workflow

Some amenities can be configured to require admin approval for bookings, while others can be auto-approved.

## DocumentService Specifics

The DocumentService acts as a central digital filing cabinet for all important community documents, offering permission-controlled access and version control.

### Integrations

*   **UserAndUnitManagement**: Integrates with this service to fetch user roles, which are crucial for permission checks (who can view/upload documents).
*   **Azure Blob Storage**: Used as the backend storage for the actual document files, ensuring scalability and reliability.

### Configuration

The DocumentService needs to know the base URL of the `UserAndUnitManagement` service and Azure Storage details. Configure these in `DocumentService/DocumentService.Api/appsettings.Development.json` (or environment variables for production):

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "AzureStorage": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME>;AccountKey=<YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
  },
  "AzureStorage": {
    "ContainerName": "documents"
  },
  "UserAndUnitManagement": {
    "BaseUrl": "http://communityconnect-userandunitmgmtapi-dev:8081"
  }
}
```

*   **`ConnectionStrings:AzureStorage`**: Your Azure Storage account connection string. For local development, `UseDevelopmentStorage=true` can be used with Azurite.
*   **`AzureStorage:ContainerName`**: The name of the blob container where documents will be stored (defaults to `documents`).
*   **`UserAndUnitManagement:BaseUrl`**: The base URL of the UserAndUnitManagement API.

### Document Categories and Permissions

*   **Categories**: Documents are organized into hierarchical categories (folders).
*   **Permissions**: Administrators can define `CanView` and `CanUpload` permissions for each category, assignable to different `UserRole`s (e.g., Owners, Tenants, Property Managers).
*   **Access Control**: All document access (viewing/downloading, uploading) is checked against these defined permissions.

### Version Control

When a new version of a document is uploaded, the system automatically increments its version number, ensuring users always access the most current version. Older versions are retained in storage.
