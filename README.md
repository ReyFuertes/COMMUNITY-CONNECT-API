## Setup Instructions

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    -   .NET 8 SDK
    -   Docker Desktop
2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd community-connect
    ```
3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose**:
    Navigate to the root directory of the project (where `docker-compose.yml` is located) and run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose --profile development up -d --build
    ```
    This command will build the Docker images and start all services.

## Running the Application

Once the Docker containers are up and running, the services will be accessible at:

-   **API Gateway**: `http://localhost:8080`
-   **UserAndUnitManagement API**: `http://localhost:8081`
-   **CommunicationHub API**: `http://localhost:8082`
-   **MaintenanceService API**: `http://localhost:8083`
-   **FinanceService API**: `http://localhost:8084`
-   **SecurityService API**: `http://localhost:8085`

## Testing Real-Time Notifications

To test the SignalR functionality:
1.  Ensure the services are running via Docker.
2.  Navigate to `CommunicationHub/CommunicationHub.Client`.
3.  Run the client: `dotnet run`.
4.  Use the Swagger UI or Gateway to send a message/announcement, and observe the client console.

## API Documentation (Swagger)

Each microservice provides Swagger UI for easy exploration:

-   **UserAndUnitManagement Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8081/swagger`
-   **CommunicationHub Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8082/swagger`
-   **MaintenanceService Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8083/swagger`
-   **FinanceService Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8084/swagger`
-   **SecurityService Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8085/swagger`

## FinanceService Specifics

The FinanceService handles all financial transactions, including online payments and expense tracking.

### Payment Gateway Configuration

For online payments to function, you must configure the API keys for Stripe and Xendit (for local e-wallets like GCash, PayMaya, GrabPay, GoTyme). These settings are found in `FinanceService/FinanceService.Api/appsettings.Development.json` and should be managed securely in production environments (e.g., Kubernetes secrets, Azure Key Vault).

Example `appsettings.json` (replace placeholders with actual keys):

```json
{
  "Stripe": {
    "SecretKey": "sk_live_YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY",
    "SuccessUrl": "http://yourfrontend.com/payment/success",
    "CancelUrl": "http://yourfrontend.com/payment/cancel"
  },
  "Xendit": {
    "SecretKey": "xnd_live_YOUR_XENDIT_SECRET_KEY",
    "SuccessUrl": "http://yourfrontend.com/payment/success",
    "FailureUrl": "http://yourfrontend.com/payment/failure"
  }
}
```

### Azure Blob Storage for Proofs of Payment

The FinanceService uses Azure Blob Storage for storing uploaded proofs of payment (e.g., bank transfer receipts).

Configure your Azure Storage connection string and container name in `FinanceService/FinanceService.Api/appsettings.Development.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "AzureStorage": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME>;AccountKey=<YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
  },
  "AzureStorage": {
    "ContainerName": "payment-proofs"
  }
}
```

*   **`ConnectionStrings:AzureStorage`**: Your Azure Storage account connection string. For local development, `UseDevelopmentStorage=true` can be used with Azurite.
*   **`AzureStorage:ContainerName`**: The name of the blob container where receipts will be stored (defaults to `payment-proofs`).

### Webhook Endpoints

To receive real-time payment status updates, you must configure webhooks with your payment providers:

*   **Stripe**: Configure a webhook endpoint pointing to `http://localhost:8080/api/finance/webhooks/stripe` (adjust for production URL) for `checkout.session.completed` events.
*   **Xendit**: Configure a webhook endpoint pointing to `http://localhost:8080/api/finance/webhooks/xendit` (adjust for production URL) for `invoice paid` and `invoice expired` events.

## SecurityService Specifics

The SecurityService handles visitor management, check-ins, and parcel tracking.

### Azure Blob Storage for Parcel Photos

The SecurityService uses Azure Blob Storage to store photos of received parcels.

Configure your Azure Storage connection string and container name in `SecurityService/SecurityService.Api/appsettings.Development.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "AzureStorage": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME>;AccountKey=<YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
  },
  "AzureStorage": {
    "ContainerName": "security-files"
  }
}
```

*   **`ConnectionStrings:AzureStorage`**: Your Azure Storage account connection string. For local development, `UseDevelopmentStorage=true` can be used with Azurite.
*   **`AzureStorage:ContainerName`**: The name of the blob container where parcel photos will be stored (defaults to `security-files`).

### Visitor Access Code / QR Code Generation

The API generates a unique access code (string) for visitor passes. Frontend applications can then use this string to generate a scannable QR code image.

### Guard Application

Security personnel can use a dedicated application (mobile/tablet) to:
*   Scan visitor QR codes to check guests in/out.
*   Log new parcels and upload photos.
